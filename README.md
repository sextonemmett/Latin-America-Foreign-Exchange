Foundations of Data Science Final Project

This project uses publicly available histroical equities, rates, and futures prices to predict the direction of FX changes for the following day for four Latin American currencies: Chile, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia.

Models are trained using daily data from 2010â€“2022 and tested on data from Jan 2023 through October 2023.

Prediction accuracy and ROC performance is compared across four model types: Elastic Net, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
